# Weather-cast-12000
This will be my first project using an API

Started with developing an object to capture all of the needed date from the weather API and store it for later display
had issues with ajax working in the JS document, determined to be related to the jquery link was refferencing a slim
version. Had an asynchronus issue when calling on uv data now fixed and I can currently create a complete object of
current weather data. moving onto html formatting before expanding on future data.


using the API and displaying the data wasn't particularly difficult in this project, but rather the dynamically created elemnts 
in particular the buttons that gave me the most difficulty. initially I used a prompt for user input to get the code pulling and displaying it.
